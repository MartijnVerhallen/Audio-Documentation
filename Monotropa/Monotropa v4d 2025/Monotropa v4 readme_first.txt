Confusingly, there are 2 versions of Monotropa v4d 2025

Look at the PCB at the upper right below the version number.
--> If you see r1, r2, r3, and r4 underneath each other, you have version v4h
--> If you see r6, r7, r20 and r9 underneath each other, you have version v4f

The reason for this is that I forgot to change the version numbers while making revisions.
Sorry about this!

The two BOMs are listed in this folder.
