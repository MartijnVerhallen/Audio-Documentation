MODS				
				
Noise		
c13, c12, c9 and c8 determine the pitches of the 4 squarewave oscillators that form the noise source.				
You can experiment with these values for different flavours (lower is slower, higher is noisier)
Bridge IC 4049 pin 5 & 6 for a wider noise range
				
Filter			
c5 and c6 set the frequency range of the drone oscillators 				
c7 and r6 set the lowpass filter cutoff range

Mixer				
r1, r2, r11 set the mix amount of the 3 sources (2x drone osc and noise)
